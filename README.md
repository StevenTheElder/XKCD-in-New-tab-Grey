# XKCD in Newtab Dark

This is a simple firefox addon that adds a random XKCD in your new tab I have taken the idea from http://simplyluke.com/ just changed the background to a diffrent colour and centered everything.

[You can view the addon and get it here](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-GB/developers/addon/xkcd-new-tab-grey).
